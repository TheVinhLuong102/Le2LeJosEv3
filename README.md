# Lego2LeJosEv3
A LeJOS EV3 Implementation of _LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Programming Blocks (icons)_.
Please see the **Lego2LeJosEv3_Handbook** for more details. It is a LibreOffice Writer 6.0 document.

## Library
The **LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3** Library sits on top of the current version of the LeJOS EV3 framework. I am using the LeJOS EV3 v0.9.1beta (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/) framework and a standard LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

The LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3 Library intends to provide Java programmers with methods that are similar to use as the Lego Programming Blocks (icons). 
This library leaves the control structures, calculations, and variable or constant handling to the Java programming language, because they are much easier to read in Java.

The LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3 Library is _not_ complete by far.
However, it still makes it easy to port a LEGO icon-based Program to the Java language on top of the LeJOS EV3 framework. 
I plan to build further robots and port their LEGO icon-based programs to LeJOS EV3 and thereby extending the LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3 library more and more.

## How To Use
If you want to use the _LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3_ Library in your own LeJOS EV3 project, just copy the classes in the packages
_lego2lejosev3.pblocks_ and _lego2lejosev3.logging_ into your project.

## Projects
The following projects - which I am aware of - use the _LEGO 2 LeJOS EV3_ Library:
