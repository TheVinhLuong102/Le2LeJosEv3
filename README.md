# Le2LeJosEv3
A LeJOS EV3 Implementation of _LEGO® Mindstorms EV3 Programming Blocks (icons)_.
Please see the **Le2LeJosEv3_Handbook** for more details. It is a LibreOffice Writer 6.0 document. (You can download LibreOffice at https://www.libreoffice.org/)

## Library
The **Le2LeJosEv3** Library sits on top of the LeJOS EV3 framework: I am using the LeJOS EV3 v0.9.1beta (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/) framework and a standard LEGO® Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

The _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library intends to provide Java programmers with methods that are similar to use as the LEGO® Programming Blocks (icons).

The library leaves the control structures, calculations, and variable or constant handling to the Java programming language, because they are much easier to read in Java.

The _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library is _not_ complete by far.
However, it still makes it easy to port a LEGO® icon-based Program to the Java language on top of the LeJOS EV3 framework. 
I plan to build further robots and port their LEGO® icon-based programs to LeJOS EV3 and thereby extending the _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library more and more.

## How To Use
If you want to use the _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library in your own LeJOS EV3 project, do one of the following:
1. Just include the _le2lejosev3.jar_ file in your project's classpath. The LeJOS EV3 Eclipse plugin will download the _le2lejosev3.jar_ file to the EV3 brick automatically before running your program.
2. Just copy the Java source files in the packages _le2lejosev3.pblocks_ and _le2lejosev3.logging_ into your project's source location.

Anyways, the LeJOS EV3 Eclipse plugin will download the main program to the EV3 brick and run it there.
